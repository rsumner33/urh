This plugin enables you to detect Preamble/Midamble/Postamble in a protocol and auto assign a protocol label to these sequences.
You can specify the Amble-Pattern and minimum amble length use for detection.

Note: If the preamble pattern matches from the second bit of a block, the first bit of the block will also be assigned to the preamble
